## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the API locally for development or testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
- **Go (Golang)**: Make sure you have Go installed. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Redis** (optional for caching): Redis is required if you plan to use caching.
- **RabbitMQ** (optional for message queue): RabbitMQ is required for asynchronous image processing.

### Database Setup

1. **Create the Database**:
   Log into your PostgreSQL and create a database named `product_db`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE product_db;
Create Tables: Run the following SQL to create the necessary tables:

sql
Copy code
-- Create users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

-- Create products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),  -- Foreign key reference to users table
    product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    product_description TEXT,
    product_images TEXT[],  -- Array of image URLs
    product_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    compressed_product_images TEXT[], -- Array of compressed image URLs
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
API Endpoints
The API supports the following endpoints:

POST /products

Description: Adds a new product to the database.
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "product_name": "Product Name",
  "product_description": "Product Description",
  "product_images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"],
  "product_price": 19.99
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 1,
  "message": "Product created successfully"
}
GET /products/:id

Description: Retrieves product details by ID.
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": 1,
  "product_name": "Product Name",
  "product_description": "Product Description",
  "product_images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"],
  "product_price": 19.99,
  "compressed_product_images": ["compressed_image1.jpg", "compressed_image2.jpg"]
}
GET /products

Description: Retrieves all products for a specific user_id, with optional filtering by price range and product name.
Query Parameters:
user_id: User ID to filter by.
min_price (optional): Minimum price to filter by.
max_price (optional): Maximum price to filter by.
product_name (optional): Filter by product name.
Response:
json
Copy code
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "product_name": "Product Name",
    "product_description": "Product Description",
    "product_images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"],
    "product_price": 19.99
  }
]
Installation
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-api.git
cd product-api
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have all the necessary Go dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
Run the API: To run the API locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
Testing
Unit Tests: You can test the API endpoints using the following command:

bash
Copy code
go test
Integration Tests: These tests ensure the system works end-to-end (e.g., checking the asynchronous image processing and caching).

Benchmark Tests: To test the response time of the GET /products/:id endpoint with and without cache, use Go's built-in benchmarking tools or an external service like Postman or Apache JMeter.

#### **Step 4: Save and Commit the `README.md` File**

1. **Save** the changes to `README.md`.
2. **Commit the file** to your GitHub repository (if you're using Git):

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README with project setup and API details"
git push origin main
Step 5: Verify
Once the file is committed, navigate to your GitHub repository in a web browser. You should see the README.md file rendered correctly with all the sections.
Users can now refer to this README.md to set up the project, understand the database setup, API endpoints, and run the application.
Summary of What You Pasted in the README.md
Instructions on how to create and set up the product_db and necessary tables in PostgreSQL.
API endpoints with detailed request and response formats.
Installation instructions, including how to clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the project.
Details about testing and running benchmarks for the project.
License information for the repository.
This should give anyone a clear understanding of how to set up and run your API. Let me know if you need any further clarification!

Yes, you should include the API endpoints section with details like the POST /products in your README.md file. This provides essential information for developers or users who want to interact with your API, such as the request format, response format, and descriptions of what each endpoint does.

Here's the section you need to include in your README.md file, which explains the POST /products endpoint:
